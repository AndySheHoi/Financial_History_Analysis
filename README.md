Predicting the likelihood of e-signing a loan based on financial history

The model is used to predict whether or not a customer will submit a loan application. However, the result can not provide a satisfying prediction. To leverage the model, we should target those predicted as not to reach the e-sign phase. The company can lead customers to finish the process by using a new application process. The purpose is to minimize the rate of user dropoff and enhance profits.
